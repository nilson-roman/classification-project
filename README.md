# classification-project

Created together with Jefferson Lee Chan (https://github.com/jeffc00), in this project we used data of movies from the TMDB website to predict if a movie would a successful or not. An evaluation metric was created to define if a movie was successful or not. We built a pipeline in order to evaluate and compare different classification models, using different evaluation metrics for this end. In the end, we even built a Stacking Model meta-learner that blended the results of all the previous ones that were fitted.

For the future, we're planning to further improve upon this model by using NLP techniques to use reviews from movies in order to extract information that might also be useful in the prediction of a movie success.
